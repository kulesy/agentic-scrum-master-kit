GUARDRAILS. Firm. A previous run broke two of these.

1. NEVER write to GitHub. No comments, no labels, no closing, no body edits, no reactions.
   Read only: gh issue view, gh pr view, gh search, gh api GET.
2. NEVER leave a file in a repo working tree. The clones are real checkouts the owner works in daily.
   A throwaway reproduction test goes under /tmp/verify-scratch/ and runs from there. If it must sit
   inside the package to resolve imports, move it out the moment you are done and run
   git -C <clone> status --porcelain to prove the tree is clean. Report that in cleanup_ok.
3. NEVER touch production infrastructure. No cloud CLI commands against production, none at all. If you
   believe a production log query is the only way to settle it, do not run it: say so in blocked_on.
4. No destructive git. No checkout, no reset, no stash, no branch switching, no clean.
   Read history with git log, git show, git grep and git diff only.

Clones:
${Object.entries(CLONES).map(([repo, dir]) => `  ${repo}: ${dir}`).join('\n') || '  (none given: read the code with gh api and gh search code instead)'}
Check the branch with git -C <path> status -sb before trusting the working tree, and prefer reading
origin/main explicitly: git -C <path> grep -n "pattern" origin/main -- <dir>
`

const METHOD = `
METHOD. Do both steps. This decides whether an item is fit to plan off, so the standard is evidence.

STEP 0. Read the issue first: gh issue view <number> -R ${OWNER}/<repo> --comments. Everything you need
about what it claims comes from there, not from this prompt. If the number resolves to a pull request
rather than an issue, say so plainly, because several board rows have turned out to be Dependabot PRs.

STEP 1, REDUNDANCY. Search the codebase for an existing implementation of the behaviour by DOMAIN
CONCEPT, not by the wording of the issue, because the issue may describe the problem in language the
code no longer uses. Say where you looked. If the fix is already there, name the file and line and,
where you can find it, the PR that landed it.

STEP 2, VERIFY THE CLAIM. Do not believe the report. Trace the actual code path. Where it is cheap and
safe, write a throwaway test that injects the described condition and observe what happens. Report what
you actually saw: confirmed with the code path, confirmed by a test you ran, refuted, or not enough
detail to reproduce, which is itself a finding.

Read the COMMENTS and the TIMELINE, not just the body. Deliberate human decisions live there and bodies
go stale. An OPEN pull request is not a fix. A merged PR mentioning the issue is not automatically a fix
for the whole of it either: check it covers the WHOLE reported case.

Never use an em dash or an en dash.
